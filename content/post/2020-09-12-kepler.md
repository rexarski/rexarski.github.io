Played around with [Kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/) for a while. It really makes geospatial visualization easy-peasy. Take my trial as an example: I grabbed [Cyclist Crashes data](https://www.data.act.gov.au/Justice-Safety-and-Emergency/Cyclist-Crashes/n2kg-qkwj) from Open Data Portal dataACT, mutated a timestamp variable and character date variable to form a usable datetime. Then I just flushed everything inside the CSV into Kepler.gl. Then it’s done. The best part is, you can export or share the visualization as an image, html or json for replication.
